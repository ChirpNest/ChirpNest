# ChirpStack Gateway OS installation

**Important:** If your gateway is not in the list below then you can still use
the ChirpStack open-source LoRaWAN<sup>&reg;</sup> Network Server stack! The ChirpStack
Gateway OS is only to make things more easy, it is not a requirement.

If you are a gateway vendor and would like to see your gateway added to the
list, please reach out!
